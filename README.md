# javaLowLevel 

This repository and many others owned by me are in flux and used to collect code for self teaching projects. I enjoyed and as such had lots of fun (re)-learning Java and related languages in the last two years. The Oracle MOOC courses covering Raspberry Pi, Lambdas and Streams were particularly interesting. There is some original work here ... along with many modified examples. 

some examples of simple java and also some lambda and streams
